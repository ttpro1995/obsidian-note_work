Today, I install [[Obsidian Git]] ([github](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git))

I still wonder whether to .gitignore the path `.obsidian/` or not.

Currently, I only ignore `.obsidian/workspace`. As I see, Obsidian also save config, plugin setting and such, so, other `.obsidian/` might come handy if it sync as well.
